# MathTrace
Additional code for math trace recognition project in CS523 that yields improved results and fixes the cde code in [main report linked repo](https://github.com/du00d/MathTrace). 

File explanation - 

```updated_cnn.py```: optimized CNN that yields higher accuracy and precision and recall than other repo

```experiment_with_optimizer_act_func_pooling.ipynb```: experimented with various optimizers, activation functions and pooling layers to optimize CNN model.

```data_augmentation_ex.ipynb```: experimented with data augmentation to optimize CNN model

```bilinear_exp.ipynb```: experimented by adding a bilinear layer to CNN model to try and optimize 

```updated_cde_with_more_layers.ipynb```: fixed the errors that were happening on cde code in cde folder in [main report linked repo](https://github.com/du00d/MathTrace) to yield a recall and precision and explanation of bug fixes is given in addendum report.

All results and files and experiments are detailed in addendum report.
